# ProCalculator | Laboratory Work #1: Development of a Static Web Interface
**Course:** Web Design  
**Student:** Poliakov Yehor  
**Group:** KV-33  

## Assignment
The goal of this assignment is to develop a static multi-page web interface for a selected application topic. The project must ensure responsive design across various screen sizes using modern CSS frameworks and demonstrate a consistent UI/UX style.

## Project Overview
ProCalculator (Programmer's Calculator) is a non-commercial educational project developed as part of a Web Design laboratory assignment. The primary objective is to create a clean, responsive user interface that serves a universal tool for everyday calculations and a specialized mode for software developers.

This application demonstrates practical skills in modern web development standards, focusing on a flexible grid system and consistent UI elements across all devices.
